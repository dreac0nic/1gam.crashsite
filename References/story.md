and other information regarding world interaction. If you wish to enjoy the game

## Overview

CRASHSITE is a story set to confront the player with a series of moral and ethical
decisions that influence their role in the story itself. During the events of the game,
the facility the player is thrown into is attempting to build a mass world terriformer.
The intent for this device is to be used as a way to make further words livable to secure
the future of the massively expanding race of species.

However, due to the nature of this device, it requires the entirety of a world's
life systems to be destroyed and rearranged to make way for the involved race. In the
majority of cases, this means that any native life to this world would be killed
in the process.

Striking heavy moral conflict, the issue encouraged the establishment of the Planetary
Rights Confederation. The front face of the PRC attempt to publically confront issues
related to the rights of individual planets and species where they deem maltreatment
abounds. Despite their good intention, the PRC have engaged in many acts of terrorism,
including the violent attack and destruction of Galactic Republic facilities aiding
in any research against the PRC's own morals.

In the events of CRASHSITE, the PRC has begun a raid on a Galactic Republic science
and research facility for the terriforming device itself, hoping to either completely
destroy all relevant research (including personnel), or steal the device itself for
their own use.

## Setting

CRASHSITE is set in the area of a military science facility exploring the area of
terriforming. Set in the deep future, the game will portray scenes and technologies
similar to those seen in Star Wars and HALO.

### Factions

There are two major factions in CRASHSITE.

#### Galactic Republic

The Galactic Republic is a universe-wide organization that attempts to unite all
governing factions within the known realms in a single unit. Representatives are
elected from different planets and factions to represent them on a universe-wide
level. While normally considered to be sided with the people that they represent,
the size and involvement of this organization has long been under the scrutinous eye
of many; as well as being the target for many conspiricy themes and theories.

#### Planetary Rights Confederation

The Planetary Rights Confederation is well known as one of the leading activists
for planetary ethics. The originations of the ethics group intended on being a
conglomeration intended to step in as a representative for any planetary group feeling
mistreated by an overarching corporation.

Due to this, they are long time rivals with the Galactic Republic. The rivalry has
grown into a violent feud.

## Player

The player is an initially anonymous character, with no locked backstory. By completing
objectives, the player begins to develop their background and path, directing them
either to the one of the PRC raiders or the Galactic Republic's security or military
police. Idealy, these objectives are to remain as anonymous, though intentional as possible.
