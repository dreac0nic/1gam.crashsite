PROJECT CRASHSITE [1GAM.6.2015]
===============================

Project CRASHSITE is a June 2015 #1GAM attempt. This project is an ambitious attempt
to follow up previous #1GAM MAYDAY with an interactive, immersive, player-driven story
that conveys the importance of morals, choice, and perception with the situations
we are given in every-day life. While the situations portrayed in CRASHSITE are, thankfully,
not often encountered in day-to-day life, CRASHSITE's goal is to show the player this importance
via an exaggerated scenario.

The project may or may not be completed in time for the end of June 2015, but will hopefully
serve to inspire those to pay extra attention to the consequences their actions have.

## Description
Project CRASHSITE is a first-person adventure game. While the game incorporates a number
of traditional shooter mechanics, the focus is on exploration and interaction with the game world.
The game will use a simple notoriety system that changes the way the player can interaction
with entities in the game world (such as NPCs). Additionally, the direction and objectives
completed by the player change the way the player is engaged by the game, allowing the player
to choose his or her own story through the direction of their actions.

This description has been kept vague due to the nature of revealing the story, and will
remain so an all front-facing texts.

### Goals
The goals of the project are used to keep track of development objectives and milestones.
These should be used as a tool to create an engaging and creative experience, not
limitations for the developer.

#### Baselines
These are some of the most basic goals for the project based on the original concept.
Hopefully this listing guides in future development choices.

 * First-Person Perspective
 * Curiousity-provoking environment to encourage player exploration
 * Simple shooter combat
    - Use of ADS dependent on player immersion tests
 * Player choice in engagement
    - Player should have the option to abstain from all confrontation
    - Player also has the choice to abstain from all confrontational abstinence
 * Rewarding exploration
    - Exploration reveals for choices
    - Items such as weapons and objective-relevant objects
    - Information

#### Priorities
While the baselines are used to guide the beginning and creation of future game goals,
the priorities are what guide decisions such as what game goals stay and which ones
get trashed.

 1. Crisp and fluid player control and interaction
 2. Approachable Game
     * Intuitive UI
     * Immersive Environment (Visually, Conceptually)
     * High reliability and predictability (Bugs breaking player engagement first)
 3. Interactive environment, giving the player the chance to explore at their will
 4. Gameplay choices (Non-confrontal, made by gameplay decisions)
 5. Replayability
